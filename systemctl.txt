Run service as a user

Place in ~/.config/systemd/user/my.service:

[Unit]
Description=My Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node app.js
WorkingDirectory=/home/$USERNAME/proxy-zapier
Environment=NODE_ENV=production
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
StartLimitInterval=60s
StartLimitBurst=3

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target

Change $USERNAME above to the desired username. Rename the servicefile ("my.service") to the actual name of the service.

Enable and start:

systemctl --user enable my.service
systemctl --user start my.service

These things must be done as the logged on user. You cannot do it through a "su" or "sudo" session. If you try you will most likely encounter the following error:

Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory
